⁜ File I/O :
• Input / Output in java is a crucial aspects of programming , allowing you to  read from and write to File.
• Java provides a rich set of classes & methods in java.io and java.nio.file packages to handle file operations.

⇒ Key Concepts and Classes 
1. File Class : The File class represents a file or directory path in the file-system

2. FileinputStream and FileOutputStream : These classes are used for reading and writing binary data

3. FileReader and FileWriter : These classes are used for reading and writing character data.

4. BufferedReader and BufferedWriter : These classes provide buffering for efficient reading and writing of characters, arrays, and lines.

5. Using hava.nio.file Package : The java.nio.file package provide more advanced file I/O capabilities.

→ Best Practises 
⁎ Use Buffered Streams: For better performance, use buffered streams like BufferedReader and BufferedWriter.

⁎ Close Resources: Always close file streams to release system resources. Use try-with-resources for automatic closing.

⁎ Handle Exceptions: Properly handle IOException to avoid runtime errors
